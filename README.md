# FinSecure_1


🏦 FinSecure Loan Default Prediction📌 Project OverviewFinSecure is a peer-to-peer lending company connecting borrowers with investors. This project aims to minimize financial losses and build trust by accurately assessing the risk of loan default.Using historical loan application data, we have developed a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of a loan being paid back in full versus defaulting. This data-driven approach replaces manual scorecards to capture complex, non-linear patterns in borrower behavior.📂 DatasetThe project uses loan_data.csv, containing historical records of loan applications.FeatureDescriptionannual_incomeAnnual income of the borrowerdebt_to_income_ratioRatio of total debt to annual incomecredit_scoreBorrower's credit scoreloan_amountTotal loan amount requestedinterest_rateInterest rate assigned to the loaneducation_levelHighest education attained (Ordinal: High School < ... < PhD)loan_purposeReason for the loan (e.g., Medical, Vacation)grade_subgradeInternal risk grade assigned by FinSecureloan_paid_backTarget Variable: 1 = Paid Back, 0 = Defaulted(Other features include gender, marital status, and employment status)🛠️ Methodology1. Preprocessing PipelineTo prepare the raw data for modeling, the following transformations were applied:Numerical Features: Missing values imputed with the median, followed by Standard Scaling to normalize range.Categorical Features: Missing values imputed with the mode, followed by One-Hot Encoding (for nominal data like loan_purpose).Ordinal Features: education_level was encoded using Ordinal Encoding to preserve the hierarchy of education.2. Model ArchitectureAlgorithm: Random Forest ClassifierReasoning: Chosen for its ability to handle non-linear relationships, robustness to outliers, and effectiveness without extensive hyperparameter tuning.Metric: Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC).🚀 How to RunPrerequisitesPython 3.xLibraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seabornRunning on Google ColabOpen the provided notebook (.ipynb file).Run the first cell to upload loan_data.csv from your local machine.Run the subsequent cells to execute the preprocessing, training, and evaluation pipelines.📊 Key ResultsThe model achieved a Global AUC of ~0.905, indicating high predictive accuracy.Subgroup Analysis (Fairness Check)To ensure the model is fair, we evaluated performance across different demographic slices:By Education Level: The model performed consistently across all levels (AUC ~0.90), showing no bias toward specific educational backgrounds.By Loan Purpose:Best Predictability: Vacation, Medical, Education loans.Hardest to Predict: Debt consolidation and Business loans (likely due to external volatility).
